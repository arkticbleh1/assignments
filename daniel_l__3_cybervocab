Brenda was at work, sorting through her email inbox and checking for any important stuff.
Suddenly, she gets an email from her sister, Jasmine.
Confused, Brenda checked the message. She didn't know why Jasmine would email her when she has her in her phone contacts.
The email read "Hey Brenda, it's me, Jasmine! I was just sending this to check up on you! How are you and your son doing? How about your husband? Oh, and just in case I plan to visit, what is the new address to your house?
Love you lots, Jasmine."
Ok, something's wrong. Jasmine was just at BRenda's house last week, and she took Brenda's son with him so they could spend some time catching up and hanging out.
Whoever sent this was obviously not Jasmine.
Brenda closed the email and called an IT person to check for viruses soon after, then resumed her work.
